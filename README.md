## [Project 1: *Codenames* AI](https://github.com/ryanhood1995/codenames_ai)

*Codenames* is a popular word game where teams compete with one another to eliminate all of their assigned words.  This is done by coming up with a codeword relating to their assigned words but not related to their opponent's assigned words.  The goal of this project is to create a *Codenames* AI capable of generating optimal codewords from a current board state.  It is also possible to have different AIs play each other to determine the best AI.  Since a bulk number of games can be played quickly, favorable strategies normally hidden in human play come to light.  This is an ongoing project in which I plan to improve as time goes on.


## [Project 2: Custom *PowerBI* Visuals](https://github.com/ryanhood1995/custom_powerbi_visuals)

*PowerBI* is one of the most popular interactive visualization tools in the world. Although there are powerful visuals that come pre-packaged with *PowerBI*, there is also the ability to create custom visuals with *PowerBI*'s development tools.


## [Project 3: Personalized *GoodReads* AI Assistant](https://github.com/ryanhood1995/good_reads)

*GoodReads* is community for book lovers to rate, review, discuss, and suggest books.  The purpose of this project is to monitor a user's *GoodReads* profile and be an all-in-one assistant for them.  The AI can congratulate them on book completion, track progress, and recommend new books based on past ratings or reviews.


## [Project 4: Perspective Transformation to Cash Checks Electronically](https://github.com/ryanhood1995/perspective_transform_on_checks)

Nowadays, almost every online banking platform allows users to cash checks by taking a picture of it.  The picture can be taken from many different angles and distances.  The goal of this project is to take a series of images of checks, and correct the images so that it appears the camera is perfectly aligned with the check and a standard distance away.  The check should correctly be identified even if someone is holding the check.
