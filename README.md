Below are some of my personal projects I am most proud of.  To see a full list of my personal projects, feel free to explore my Github at (https://github.com/ryanhood1995).


## [Project 1: Codenames AI](https://github.com/ryanhood1995/codenames_ai)

Codenames is a popular word game where teams compete with one another to eliminate all of their assigned words.  This is done by coming up with a codeword relating to their assigned words but not related to their opponent's assigned words.  The goal of this project is to create a Codenames AI capable of generating optimal codewords from a current board state.  It is also possible to have different AIs play each other to determine the best AI.  Since a bulk number of games can be played quickly, favorable strategies normally hidden in human play come to light.  This is an ongoing project in which I plan to improve as time goes on.




## [Project 2: Custom PowerBI Visuals](https://github.com/ryanhood1995/custom_powerbi_visuals)

PowerBI is one of the most popular interactive visualization tools in the world. Although there are powerful visuals that come pre-packaged with PowerBI, there is also the ability to create custom visuals with PowerBI's development tools.


## [Project 3: Personalized GoodReads AI Assistant
