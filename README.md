## [Project 1: Codenames AI] (https://github.com/ryanhood1995/codenames_ai)

Codenames is a popular word game where teams compete with one another to eliminate all of their assigned words.  This is done by coming up with a codeword relating to their assigned words but not related to their opponent's assigned words.  The goal of this project is to create a Codenames AI capable of generating optimal codewords from a current board state.  It is also possible to have different AIs play each other to determine the best AI.  Since a bulk number of games can be played quickly, favorable strategies normally hidden in human play come to light.  This is an ongoing project in which I plan to improve as time goes on.
